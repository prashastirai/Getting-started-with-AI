        "Welcome to this Granite recipe, in this recipe, you'll learn to harness the power of advanced tools to build AI-powered document retrieval systems. It will guide you through:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Document Processing:** Learn to handle documents from various sources, parse and transform them into usable formats, and store them in vector databases using Docling.\n",
        "- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Understand how to connect large language models (LLMs) like Granite with external knowledge bases to enhance query responses and generate valuable insights.\n",
        "- **LangChain for Workflow Integration:** Discover how to use LangChain to streamline and orchestrate document processing and retrieval workflows, enabling seamless interaction between different components of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "This recipe leverages three cutting-edge technologies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **[Docling](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/):** An open-source toolkit for parsing and converting documents.\n",
        "2. **[Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/models/granite/):** A state-of-the-art LLM available via an [API](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api) through Replicate, providing robust natural language capabilities.\n",
        "3. **[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain):** A powerful framework for building applications powered by language models, designed to simplify complex workflows and integrate external tools seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this recipe, you will:\n",
        "- Gain proficiency in document processing and chunking.\n",
        "- Integrate vector databases to enhance retrieval capabilities.\n",
        "- Utilize RAG to perform efficient and accurate data retrieval for real-world applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This recipe is designed for AI developers, researchers, and enthusiasts looking to enhance their knowledge of document management and advanced NLP techniques.\n"

Spencer Kyte, On X @spencerkyte\\n• Dec. 8, 2024\\nThe UFC 310 preliminary card slate was outstanding, featuring six finishes and trio of entertaining three-round battles, setting the stage for a captivating pay-per-view main card at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\\nAnd the action in the Octagon delivered in a massive way.\\nDooho Choi kicked off the festivities with a standout performance against Nate Landwehr, finishing from a mounted crucifix in the third round before Bryce Mitchell followed suit one fight later, putting Kron Gracie to sleep with a pair of thudding elbows from inside his guard. After heavyweight contenders Ciryl Gane and Alexander Volkov paired off in a close, competitive fight where the former interim champion came away on the happy side of a split decision verdict, Shavkat Rakhmonov ensured he will face welterweight champ Belal Muhammad next year by out-hustling Ian Machado Garry, handing the Irishman his first professional setback.\\nIn the main event, Alexandre Pantoja successfully defended the UFC flyweight title, taking the fight to dangerous challenger Kai Asakura, finishing the Japanese striker early in the second round.\\nIt was a thrilling night in the fight capital of the world, and we have all the details on what transpired collected for you below.\\n*Main event and co-main event scheduled for five rounds.

He stung the newcomer in the first and was happy to exchange through much of the first two rounds before jumping on Asakura's back and sinking him to the canvas. From there, Pantoja attacked the choke and secured the finish.\\nThat's now three consecutive successful title defenses for the Brazilian, and arguably the most impressive effort to date inside the Octagon. The American Top Team representative remains a cut above the competition in the 125-pound weight class, and heads into next year riding a seven-fight winning streak.\\n[**Prelim Results**](https://www.ufc.com/news/prelim-results-highlights-winner-interviews-ufc-310-pantoja-vs-asakura)\\n|\\n[**Official Scorecards**](https://www.ufc.com/news/official-judges-scorecards-ufc-310-pantoja-vs-asakura)\"), Document(metadata={'pk': 460501754175029263, 'doc_id': 16, 'source': 'https://www.ufc.com/news/main-card-results-highlights-winner-interviews-ufc-310-pantoja-vs-asakura'}, page_content=\"[**Alexandre Pantoja**](/athlete/alexandre-pantoja)\\nis still your UFC flyweight champion, having submitted\\n[Kai Asakura](/athlete/kai-asakura)\\nin the second round to close out UFC 310.\\nAlexandre Pantoja Post-Fight Interview | UFC 310\\nUnlock MORE of your inner combat sports fan with UFC Fight Pass!
